		CMEM is an API (Reference Guide) and library for managing one or more blocks
		of physically contiguous memory. It also provides address translation services
		(e.g. virtual to physical translation) and user-mode cache management APIs.
		This physically contiguous memory is useful as data buffers that will be shared
		with another processor (e.g. DSP) or a hardware accelerator/DMA.  Using its
		pool-based configuration, CMEM enables users to avoid memory fragmentation,
		and ensures large physically contiguous memory blocks are available even after
		a system has been running for very long periods of time.
